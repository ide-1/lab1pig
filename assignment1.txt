*** Assignment 1 The Pig game ***

We are going to implement the dice game "Pig".
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29
A run of the program is shown below.

If new to programming is't assumed you have done week1 exercises 1-6 (to do IO with the Player class you may want to
do week2 exercise 1)

1.  Study the functional decomposition of the program in pig.png and the code in Pig until you'we got
    a reasonable grasp of the "big picture". If confused by the sketch, try to make an own that fits better
    to your mind set (anything that may help).

2.  Start implementing the "=r"-branch only i.e. the leftmost part of the second level in the diagram.
    If unsure of methods, do test them!

3.  Add the over all if-structure over the "=r"-branch and implement the other branches.

4.  Add a loop over the if-structure. That should finish the program (also see optional below).

    A run of the game:

    Welcome to PIG!
    First player to get 20 points will win!
    Commands are: r = roll , n = next, q = quit

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > olle
    Name for player 2 > fia
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 12
    Player is olle > r
    Got 3 running total are 15
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is fia > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is olle > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is olle > r
    Got 2 running total are 4
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 5 running total are 5
    Player is fia > r
    Got 3 running total are 8
    Player is fia > n
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 8
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > r
    Got 3 running total are 9
    Player is olle > n
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is fia > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is fia > r
    Got 5 running total are 7
    Player is fia > r
    Got 6 running total are 13
    Game over! Winner is player fia with 21 points (if q chosen prints: Game aborted)

6. (Optional). Add a computer player (AI) to the program. A simple approach i just to name
    some player "computer". More complex solution would be to create a class for the Computer
    (possibly exchange a computer player with someone else's and let them play against each other).
    Make a copy of the existing program and continue from there.

    A run of program might look like:

    Welcome to PIG!
    First player to get 20 points will win!
    Commands are: r = roll , n = next, q = quit

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > olle
    Name for player 2 > fia
    Points: computer = 0 olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 3 running total are 3
    Player is fia > n
    Points: computer = 0 olle = 0 fia = 3
    Player is computer
    computer choose: r
    Got 5 running total are 5
    Player is computer
    computer choose: r
    Got 2 running total are 7
    Player is computer
    computer choose: n
    Points: computer = 7 olle = 0 fia = 3
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > n
    Points: computer = 7 olle = 6 fia = 3
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    etc...
